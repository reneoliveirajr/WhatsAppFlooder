## Why this script is better than others?

- More aggressive! Send more messages in less time!
- Code with fine-tunings that make the same operations faster (less memory and processing usage) to compensate for the enhanced aggressiveness of the attack.
- Instead of displaying sent messages in the console, it shows how many messages have been sent, how much time has elapsed, and how much time is left. At the end of execution, there's a summary summarizing these metrics.
