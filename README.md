# WhatsAppFlooder
The WhatsAppFlooder is a script written in JavaScript that is designed to aggressively send a flood of messages to a WhatsApp account. The main objective is to fight back against spammers, phishers, and others who bother us.

## How to use these scripts

`CAUTION: Before sending the flood, disable the internet on your cellphone. And after the flood, clean the chat messages using Web WhatsApp before turning on the internet on your cellphone again.`

1. Open WhatsApp Web using the official link: [WhatsApp Web](https://web.whatsapp.com/).
2. Log in to your WhatsApp account.
3. Disable the internet on your mobile phone (to prevent sending messages to your own phone).
4. Click on the chat that you want to flood.
5. Open the browser console utility (Ctrl+Shift+J (Windows, Linux) or Command+Option+J (macOS)).
6. Visit this repository page ([WhatsAppFlooder](https://github.com/reneoliveirajr/WhatsAppFlooder)) on GitHub by entering the URL in your browser.
7. Select your desired flood script from the repository's list of files.
8. Click on the script file to view its code.
9. Press Ctrl + A to select all of the script code.
10. Copy the selected code using Ctrl + C.
11. Return to the browser where WhatsApp Web is open with the Console Utility.
12. Paste the copied script code (Ctrl + V) into the console.
13. Enjoy the flood! You can see the status of attack in console.
14. Clean the chat messages using Web WhatsApp before turning on the internet on your cellphone again.

## Why this script is better than others?

- More aggressive! Send more messages in less time!
- Code with fine-tunings that make the same operations faster (less memory and processing usage) to compensate for the enhanced aggressiveness of the attack.
- Instead of displaying sent messages in the console, it shows how many messages have been sent, how much time has elapsed, and how much time is left. At the end of execution, there's a summary summarizing these metrics.
